    <h2>What is Chinchilla?</h2>
    <p>Chinchillas are either of two species (Chinchilla chinchilla and Chinchilla lanigera) of crepuscular rodents of the parvorder Caviomorpha. They are slightly larger and more robust than ground squirrels, and are native to the Andes mountains in
      South America. They live in colonies called "herds" at high elevations of up to 4,270 m (14,000 ft). Historically, chinchillas lived in an area that included parts of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, and Chile, but today, colonies in the wild are
      known only in Chile. Along with their relatives, viscachas, they make up the family Chinchillidae. They are also related to the chinchilla rat.

      The chinchilla has the densest fur of all mammals that live on land. In the water, the sea otter has a denser coat. The chinchilla is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who once wore its dense, velvet-like fur.By the end of the
      19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare after being hunted for their ultra-soft fur. Most chinchillas currently used by the fur industry for clothing and other accessories are farm-raised. Domestic chinchillas descended from C.
      lanigera are sometimes kept as pets, and may be considered a type of pocket pet.

      <h2>Chinchilla Diet</h2>
      <section class="grid2-container">
        <h3 class="grid2-hed">Chinchilla Food and Hay</h3>
        <p class="grid2-text-1">(1+)Chinchillas have simple diets, and are usually happiest being fed in the evening. Feed your chinchilla about 2 tablespoons of a plain timothy-based chinchilla pellet diet per day. Avoid alfalfa-based diets and
          diets
          that include dried fruits/treats. Many chinchillas will eat only the treats mixed in and not the pellets, and will become unhealthy. They should also be given free access to timothy hay, usually a handful every day or two is enough.
          Approximately 1/2 cup to 1 cup of fresh vegetables should be offered daily as well. Good choices include carrots, kale, dandelion greens, and leafy green lettuce. You can offer treats separately a few times per day. Dried fruit treats such
          as banana chips, papaya, and raisins are some of their favorites!</p>
        <p class="grid2-text-2">(0-1)Before one year, you can give some alfalfa hay.This is good for their bones. </p>

      <h2>Bathing</h2>

        <h3 class="grid3-hed">Volcanic Dust</h3>
        <p class="grid3-text">Do not ever bathe your chinchilla with water! Chinchillas keep themselves very clean and should not ever need a water bath. They bathe themselves by rolling and flipping around in a volcanic dust that is similar to their
          natural environment. This powder soaks up the oils from their fur and leaves them sparkly clean and dry. You should provide an enclosed bath house (or a bowl if you don’t mind a powdery mess), with about 1/4inch of dust in the bottom, two
          or three times per week for about 15 minutes. Chinchilla dust bath can be purchased at almost any pet store or online. Your chinchilla may also enjoy being brushed with a very soft brush. (*^▽^*)</p>

      <h2>Temperature</h2>
      <section class="grid4-container">
        <h3 class="grid4-hed">60- 70 Degrees</h3>
        <p class="grid4-text">Chinchillas must be kept cool at all times. They have thick, warm fur and can overheat easily. Keep your chinchilla in a room that is around 75 degrees or cooler, ideally 60- 70 degrees. Never let your chinchilla be in
          temperatures of 80 degrees or more for a prolonged period of time. They are naturally found in very cold regions.<br>

          Chinchillas have tons of energy and you will notice them letting it out at night. Give your baby as large a cage as possible to allow room to run and jump around. Shelves and ramps are great for chinchillas, and they enjoy different types
          of hidey huts to play in. Exercise wheel and balls are great for chinchillas but you will need to purchase the largest size you can find. Your chinchilla should also have chew sticks at all times for them to chew on and keep their teeth in
          good shape. You can find small animal wooden chew toys at most pet stores.

      <h2>Wild Lorem</h2>
      <section class="grid7-container">
        <p class="grid7-text-1">Wild chinchillas live in herds (also known as colonies) of 14-100 chinchillas in their natural habitat, not only for social interactions, but also to help fend off predators of the types mentioned above. Wild
          chinchillas will take "lookout chinchillas will remain alert to potential threats as colonies emerge from their burrows to feed and play. Chinchillas can sleep in rock crevices during hot days and explore at night when it cools down and is
          much safer, looking for food to eat. In their original habitat, chinchilla's diet is very mild, mainly fed with sparsely vegetated shrubs, cacti, berries, grasses, and they consume water dew found in rocks and shrubs in the early morning
          (such as sunrise).</p>
        <p class="grid7-text-2">Due to its dense fur, chinchillas became popular in the fur industry when Spanish colonists invaded their natural habitat in the 1500s, and chinchillas caught as many items of clothing as possible for the wealthy.
          Their failure in this attack was caused by the unsuspecting totoro being a very sensitive animal and not responding as well as travel and stress resulting in an early death. The story of how wild chinchillas were expelled from the original
          habitat of the chinchilla industry as we know it today is a bit controversial. Controversial facts, there are two view of the story. </p>
        <p class="grid7-text-3">One is the romantic story that finally gave us the beautiful pet totoro we know today and the story of each other, reflecting the totoro from its original habitat when it was nearly extinct in the fur industry in
          captivity. This aspect of the story you decided to take with you... But this is an unbiased account of the story of 1918. It was in 1918 that the mining engineer known as matthias f. first saw chinchillas on a visit to the andes. He fell in
          love with... He becomes interested in profit (from each other)... Small tuft of hair and persuaded the local Indian to sell it to him.</p>

      <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
      <section class="grid8-container">
        <p class="grid8-text-1">Chinchillas do NOT need any vaccines or shots. You should have a vet on hand who is familiar with treating chinchillas, and it is recommended that you bring your new baby in for a checkup for peace of mind. Post your
          veterinarian’s phone number on your fridge or somewhere where it won’t be lost in case of an emergency. Always call your vet if you have any serious concerns.</p>
        <p class="grid8-text-2">Bringing your new baby home is stressful for them for the first week or two, so it is normal for them to not be very interested in food when you first bring them home. This is not something to be alarmed about, they
          should start eating normally within a few days. Their poop should be hard little pellets that are mostly dry but they could also be affected by stress for the first week or so, and may be softer than expected. </p>
        <p class="grid8-text-3">Warning Signs: Drowsy looking, seems like they can’t quite fully wake up after several minutes of being awake, not active at night, not eating or drinking for over two days, blood in poop, true diarrhea, “wet” looking
          behind ears, acting lethargic, not keeping themselves as clean as normal.
          As a rule of thumb, always call a vet if you feel that something is seriously wrong.

          Note: DO NOT USE CEDAR BEDDING! IT COULD KILL YOUR CHINCHILLA!
