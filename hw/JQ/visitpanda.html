          The purpose of this base is to develop the ability of pandas to survive in the wild.Pandas are rare in the wild.In order to improve their survival rate, many babies are cared for until they grow up, which results in them losing some of
          their
          ability to survive in the wild.The base is training and improving the ability of pandas to survive and reproduce in the wild.

      <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
      <section class="grid8-container">
        <p class="grid8-text-1">Chinchillas do NOT need any vaccines or shots. You should have a vet on hand who is familiar with treating chinchillas, and it is recommended that you bring your new baby in for a checkup for peace of mind. Post your
          veterinarian’s phone number on your fridge or somewhere where it won’t be lost in case of an emergency. Always call your vet if you have any serious concerns.</p>
        <p class="grid8-text-2">Bringing your new baby home is stressful for them for the first week or two, so it is normal for them to not be very interested in food when you first bring them home. This is not something to be alarmed about, they
          should start eating normally within a few days. Their poop should be hard little pellets that are mostly dry but they could also be affected by stress for the first week or so, and may be softer than expected. </p>
        <p class="grid8-text-3">Warning Signs: Drowsy looking, seems like they can’t quite fully wake up after several minutes of being awake, not active at night, not eating or drinking for over two days, blood in poop, true diarrhea, “wet” looking
          behind ears, acting lethargic, not keeping themselves as clean as normal.
          As a rule of thumb, always call a vet if you feel that something is seriously wrong.

          Note: DO NOT USE CEDAR BEDDING! IT COULD KILL YOUR CHINCHILLA!
