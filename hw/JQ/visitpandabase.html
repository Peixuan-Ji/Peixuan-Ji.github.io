  <h3>What is this base for?</h3>
  <h4>The purpose of this base is to develop the ability of pandas to survive in the wild.Pandas are rare in the wild.In order to improve their survival rate, many babies are cared for until they grow up, which results in them losing some of their
    ability to survive in the wild.
    The base is training and improving the ability of pandas to survive and reproduce in the wild.</h4>
